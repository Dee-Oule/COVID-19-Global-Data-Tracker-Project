## 🎯 Objectives
✅ Import and clean real-world COVID-19 global data  
✅ Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations  
✅ Compare key COVID-19 metrics across countries/regions  
✅ Visualize trends using interactive charts and maps  
✅ Summarize findings in a **structured report & presentation**

**🔍 Key Insights & Reflections
1️⃣ Vaccination Rollouts:**

The USA had a fast rollout, Kenya had a steady but slower distribution. 2️⃣ Case Surges:

India witnessed major spikes during peak waves, stressing healthcare systems. 3️⃣ Death Rate Fluctuations:

Variability in death rates across regions indicates uneven pandemic impact. 4️⃣ Data Limitations:

Missing vaccination records in some periods suggest reporting inconsistencies.
